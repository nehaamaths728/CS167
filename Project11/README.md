Group 11 Chicago Crimes Project Tasks:

Task 1 Data Preparation : Cynthia Wen

Task 2: Spatial analysis: Kimbery Morris

Task 3: Temporal analysis: Neha Mathews

All tasks run as expected in the run.sh. We tried to create one pom.xml for all the files by combining all the dependencies but it was creating errors so we each included our pom.xml which runs with our respective task.
